        <hr>
        <h2 class="attention"><em>Backend (For all who are Interested)</em></h2>
        <p>The program consists of the two files.</p>
        <h3>1. Data.py</h3>
        <p>The program has two lists; one with questions; and one with the answers to the questions.
            They are setup in such a way that the questions placement in the questions list is the same as that questions
            answer's placement in the list of answers.
            The file also includes a program where you could input question and answers,
             then it will return a list of questions and answers if you want to add questions.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Main.py</h3>
        <p>
            This imports all the databases from the <em>data.py</em>. First it uses 
            a loop that is of 10 (for 10 questions). In the loop, first a random variable k is selected. 
            <br>
            <strong>K range</strong>: It is of 0 to the length of the questions. 
            <br>
            <strong>Generating Questions and Answers</strong>
            <br>
            The program sets the selected the question to <em>questions[i]</em>
            <br>
            The program sets the selected the answer to <em>answers[i]</em>
            <br>
            The progam gets the user input and then checks it with answer[i], to make sure it is right. 
            If the it matches then it prints "CORRECT" and addes 1 to the score. If it doesn't, match then it prints "Incorrect"
            along with answers[i]. And so then the questions[i] and answers[i] is deleted to prevent an repetition of questions (Not Deleted forever). 
            At end if the score is greater than 10, then the user wins. If not, they loose. 
            <br>
